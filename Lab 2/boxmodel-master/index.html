    <h1>There's no magic in the box model</h1>

    <p>It was a dark and stormy night. Suddenly, a shot rang out! A door slammed. The maid screamed. A pirate ship appeared on the horizon! While millions of people were starving, the king lived in luxury.</p>

    <p>Good grief! Everywhere you go you seem to run into phonies! The people you think are sincere usually turn out not to be, and the people you think aren't sincere usually turn out to be sincere! The question is, how do you tell the phonies from the realies? I guess I talk too much. My mom is mad at me, my grandma is mad at me, everyone is mad at me. Yesterday my grandma drank 32 cups of coffee. I shouldn't have said anything. I suggested that perhaps her drinking 32 cups of coffee was not unlike my need for a security blanket. She didn't like the comparison.</p>

    <p>Dear Santa Claus, how have you been? Please don't get the idea that I am writing because I want something. Nothing could be further from the truth. I want nothing. If you want to skip our house, go right ahead. I won't be offended. Really I won't. Spend your time elsewhere. I really mean it. What in the world kind of letter is this? I'm hoping that he'll find my attitude particularly refreshing.</p>
